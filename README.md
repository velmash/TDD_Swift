This is the code repository for [Test-Driven iOS Development with Swift](https://www.packtpub.com/product/test-driven-ios-development-with-swift-fourth-edition/9781803232485), published by Packt.

**Write maintainable, flexible, and extensible code using the power of TDD with Swift 5.5**

## What is this book about?
Test-driven development (TDD) is a proven way to find software bugs earlier on in software development. Writing tests before you code improves the structure and maintainability of your apps, and so using TDD in combination with Swift 5.5's improved syntax leaves you with no excuse for writing bad code.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Implement TDD in Swift application development
* Detect bugs before you run code using the TDD approach
* Use TDD to build models, view controllers, and views
* Test network code with asynchronous tests and stubs
* Write code that's a joy to read and maintain
* Design functional tests to suit your software requirements
* Discover scenarios where TDD should be applied and avoided

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
func DDHAssertEqual<A: Equatable, B: Equatable>
(_ first: [A:B],
_ second: [A:B]) {
if first == second {
return
}

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for iOS developers looking to apply TDD to build maintainable and scalable applications. Intermediate-level developers with Swift application development experience will be able to make the most out of this book. Prior experience of applying TDD to Swift applications is not required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).

### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software/Hardware required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |

## Get to Know the Author

**Dr. Dominik Hauser** 
completed his PhD in physics from the University of Heidelberg. While working as a university professor, he started iOS development in his spare time. His first app on physics has been an astounding success worldwide. Since then, he has turned himself into a full-time iOS developer, with a number of successful apps to his name. He has been a Swift developer since day one and runs a blog on iOS development.
